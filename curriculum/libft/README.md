# Libft

```
Libft is a project that is often completed as part of the curriculum for computer science programs at schools and universities. The goal of the project is to provide students with an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how functions work by implementing their own versions of standard C library functions.

Typically, the libft project requires students to implement a set of functions that are commonly used in C programming. These functions may include functions for manipulating strings, such as strlen, strcpy, and strdup, as well as functions for working with memory, such as memset and memcpy. Students are usually required to write their own versions of these functions from scratch, without using any existing implementations of these functions that may be provided by the standard C library.

The purpose of the libft project is to help students develop a strong foundation in C programming by giving them the opportunity to write their own versions of commonly used functions. It also helps students to better understand

how these functions work and how they can be used to solve problems. By writing their own versions of these functions, students can also learn about the trade-offs and limitations of different approaches to solving problems, and they can gain experience debugging and testing their own code.

The libft project can be a challenging and rewarding experience for students, as it requires them to think critically and creatively about how to solve problems using C programming. It can also be a useful learning experience for those who are interested in working with C or other low-level programming languages in the future, as it helps to build the skills and knowledge needed to effectively work with these languages.
